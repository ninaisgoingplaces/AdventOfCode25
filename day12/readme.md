Okay, here my *confirmation bias* hit me once again.

I pretty early noticed, that I could reduce the set of possible 
lines by just adding all the occupied "#" in the patterns. So the
pattern 

    ###
    ##.
    ##.

would need at least 7 open space, no matter how the pattern or the free
space is oriented. This told me that 490 lines could never fit all patterns.
But I never really input 1000 - 490 = 510 as the solution as I was convinced,
that this is just the first pruning.

After consulting reddit I learned, that this indeed is the solution,
because the "real" problem would be way too hard for AoC.

I really have to deal with my confirmation bias!
